# Wimbledon winners by age

It's interesting to see the age ramps while a cohort or single player dominates,
followed by 'resets' when the guard changes. The Williams Sisters are also a feature. Can you spot them?

```{r}
wimbledon_winners %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tournament_date, y = age, group = name )) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(gender)) +
  labs(title = "Age of Wimbledon Winners",
       subtitle = "grouped by player",
       x = "date")
  

```
